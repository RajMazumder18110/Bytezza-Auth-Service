# Bytezza Authentication Service

Bytezza's authentication service is built using a microservices architecture to deliver a secure, scalable, and flexible authentication solution tailored for a multi-tenant pizza marketplace. Designed with tenants and end-users in mind, this service allows restaurant owners to register as tenants, manage their admin credentials, and oversee user access within their own tenant space.

For users, Bytezza’s authentication service enables seamless registration and login, providing a personalized experience while safeguarding data through industry-standard encryption and secure token management. By leveraging microservices, Bytezza ensures each tenant’s data and access protocols remain isolated, promoting security and reliability across the platform.

This foundational service is built to support future growth, including integration with other Bytezza services like pizza ordering, inventory, and payment management, ultimately enhancing the user experience in Bytezza’s vibrant, tenant-driven ecosystem.
